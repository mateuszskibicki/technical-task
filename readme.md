# Netacea - Technical Task

## What is the task?

The technical task is as follows, and you may use any language you wish to complete it:

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## How to run the code?

- clone repo
- install dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn`)
- run code (`npm run start` or `yarn start`)
- prompt will ask you to provide length of the array (if error or not provided - default is `100`)
- you should see logged object now
- run tests - `npm run test` or `yarn test`
